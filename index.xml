      <description>Many people are put off by Git because it seems difficult. For people transitioning from SVN, for example, the idea of local commits is often difficult to grasp. Using the command line tools is even more off-putting for people used to rich GUI tools.
However, after getting past the initial learning curve, you start feeling the power of Git on the command line.
But before saying anything else, I want to argue for using Git on the command line as the only way to really learn Git.</description>

      <description>Intro A while ago I stumbled upon this article by Antonio Leiva about implementing the MVP architecture in Android. I’ve always wanted to organize my code better, and MVP sounded like a good idea. I theory, Android is all about MVC, with the Activity or Fragment being the controller and the view defined in XML layouts. In practice, you end up with a lot of view logic in the Activity. The MVP approach promises to solve this by assuming that the Activity or Fragment is the view, controlled by a Presenter.</description>
