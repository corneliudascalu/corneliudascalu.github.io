After a very long break (several years) during which a lot of things happened in my personal and professional life, I decided to give this blogging thing another go. Not necessarily because of an unquenchable thirst for writing, but to help me keep track of my ongoing projects and things I learn.

So, without further ado, I'm starting a series of posts documenting my experience developing a small mobile app using different technologies for different platforms. I'll start with (Flutter)[TODO] versus native Android (hopefully in two flavors, one using the old UI framework and another using the Compose declarative UI). I'm setting React Native and Kotlin Multiplatform as stretch goals.
