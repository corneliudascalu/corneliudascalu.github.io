After a very long break of several years during which a lot of things happened in my personal and professional life, I decided to give this blogging thing another go. Not necessarily because of an unquenchable thirst for writing, but to help me keep track of my ongoing projects and things I learn.

So, without further ado, I'm starting a series of posts documenting my experience developing a small mobile application using different technologies for different platforms. I'll start with (Flutter)[https://flutter.dev] versus native Android (hopefully in two flavors, one using the classic UI and another using the Compose declarative UI). If everything goes well and I don't lose interest, I'd like to try React Native and Kotlin Multiplatform as well.

As a recent father of three (one toddler and two twin newborns) working from home, this is going to either be one my greatest personal accomplishments or a hard lesson in work - life balance.

The application I intend to build is quite simple, with potential for additional features. It's basically a calculator I'm going to use for mixing bread dough. It needs to be able to give me quantities of flour, water, salt and sourdough starter based on an desired ratio of flour to water in the final dough. The entire "business logic" should be just a few lines of code, so the bulk of the work will be creating a pleasant UX.

Once I have an MVP I can use, I would like to add more useful features, like custom ingredients, a recipe generator and a log to keep track of the bread I bake.

This app will scratch a personal itch. I'm baking sourdough bread as a hobby. Each time I prepare a new batch of dough I need to whip out my phone calculator, type with flour-dusted fingers and maybe sticky with dough. It's not pretty. So an app that saves me this step would be a small but significant improvement.

Let's see how this goes.
